++++++GAME DESCRIPTION++++++++++
Robot vs The Mothership is a game in which the playable character, a robot, has to collect points that take the form of energy spheres and
deliver them to the mothership. During the hunt, the drone is actively trying to catch up to the robot and take away the collected points.
This is a 3rd person, 3D video game, set in a desert-like environment. The game includes self-made models and imported assets, as well as self made-animations to better illustrate the experience.
